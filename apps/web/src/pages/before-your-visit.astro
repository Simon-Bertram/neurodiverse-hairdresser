            <strong>Arrival.</strong> You tell Lucy where to park and whether to ring
            the bell or text when she arrives. She will wait for you to be ready before
            she comes in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The consultation.</strong> Lucy will ask what you would like.
            You can point at pictures in a style menu, use words, or show her a photo.
            She will not rush you.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The wash.</strong> If having your head touched or water is difficult,
            you can ask for a dry cut instead. Lucy will tell you what she is going
            to do before she does it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The cut.</strong> Lucy uses scissors or clippers. She can tell
            you about any sounds (e.g. clippers) before she uses them. You can ask
            for a break or to stop at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment and goodbye.</strong> You can pay by contactless card.
            If you want to leave a tip, we can agree that in advance so you do not
            have to decide on the spot. Then Lucy will say goodbye and leave.
